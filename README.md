# Introduction
This is a flutter mobile application for displaying user profile on launch. The app was made using different Flutter dependencies for general responsiveness and a few tweaks for effective user experience; the landscape mode of the app looks a little bit messy and is still been worked on but the portrait view works on all mobile device types and screen sizes.
